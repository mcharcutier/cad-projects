## Goal ##
The aim of this project was to develop and print a snap fit enclosure for my keychain prototypes. This was my first time developing and printing a snap-fit enclosure,so I wanted the enclosure to serve a specific purpose, while also not being unnecessarily large. At the same time, I wanted to challenge myself, so I sought to design a slot designated for the keychain to rest in.
