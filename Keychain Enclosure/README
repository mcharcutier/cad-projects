# **Keychain Enclosure v.1**

## **Overview**
The aim of this project was to develop and print a snap fit enclosure for my keychain prototypes. 

## **Goal**
Design a compact snap-fit enclosure that securely houses a keychain while incorporating a centered docking slot, balancing print reliability, fit tolerance, and material efficiency. 

## **Success Criteria**
Keychain fits securely in dock without force
Lid snaps on/off without permanent deformation
Lid and body assemble without interference
Print completes without layer fusion or deformation

## **Process**
To better understand what to take into account while developing the enclosure, I referenced a tutorial to make the snap fit feature. 
→ [HOW TO CREATE A SNAP FIT IN FUSION360 - adam james](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcLT5Hz9-mk&t=318s)
- I imported the keychain for which I wanted the enclosure to house. I constrained the dimensions of the enclosure around the keychain, wanting the dock to be at the center of the enclosure. 

## **Notes**

### *v.1.0* 
→ The dock designed to store the keychain within the enclosure was not big enough for the keychain to fit, leading me to offset it in v.1.1. 
>> I did not print the lid of v.1.0 because of the keychain not being able to fit. To me, that took higher precedent as my objective was for both criteria to be met: the keychain must fit, and the snap - fit mechanism must work. 

### *v.1.1*
→ I offsetted the sketch for the dock by .2mm providing enough clearnace for the print to fit. 
→ The internal corners of the lid needed to be filleted in order for the lid to fit the body of v.1.1.. Since the corners of the lid were sharper than the inner corners of the body of the enclosure, the lid was unable to fit inside the box. Despite that issue, however, the lid was able to fit the body of v.1.0. 
→ I also wanted the lid to be shelled to save filament while printing it. 
→ While printing the lid, I noticed that the layers at the top of the lid fused with the bottom layers in a slanted angle. 

### *v.1.2* 
→ For this model, I designed a new lid from scratch, as I found that editing the previous lid to be too time-consuming and timeline-complex for my current capacity.
→ Boundary sketch was offsetted by .6mm to provide clearance between the inner part of the lid and the body of the enclosure. 
→ Lid was shelled with a thickness of 1.6mm. 
→ Shared the same issue as the lid of v.1.1 while printing. While troubleshooting this issue I understood that the top surface flow rate was too high for the extruder.

## **Manufacturing Notes**
Printed in PLA on Neptune 4
Layer fusion at lid interface traced to excessive top surface flow rate
Geometry was sound; issue was slicer/material tuning rather than CAD error

## **Next Steps**
Reprint lid with corrected top surface flow rate (100% → 95%)
Convert lid and body into separate components for assembly validation
Apply snap-fit learnings to a larger functional enclosure
