### Rayhan Nyalamadugula ###
Mechanical Engineering student that is interested in CAD, 3D printing, and design iteration.
This repository serves as a hub for my engineering and fabrication projects.

## Focus Areas
- Parametric CAD (Fusion 360)
- 3D printing & enclosure design
- Design iteration and tolerance analysis
- Clear technical documentation

## Featured Projects
### 🔹 3D Printed Enclosure (Neptune 4)
Design and iteration of a snap-fit enclosure with emphasis on tolerances and print behavior.  
→ 

### 🔹 Keychain Design
Small-scale functional print focused on geometry, aesthetics, and usability.  
→ 

*(More projects will be added as I continue building.)*

## Tools & Technologies
- Fusion 360
- FDM 3D Printing (Elegoo Neptune 4)
- Git & GitHub
- PLA / basic materials testing

## Documentation Philosophy
I document:
- design decisions
- failures and fixes
- what I would do differently next time
