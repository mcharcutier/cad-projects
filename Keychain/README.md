# **Keychain Model**

## **Overview**
The aim of this project was to design a functional keychain prototype that explores the utilization of components and fully constraining sketches. 

## **Success Criteria**
→ The loop of the keychain must be able to fit standard keyrings.

→ The keychain must be able to withstand normal handling without the layers separating. 

→ The keychain must be able to comfortably rest in one hand, with its overall dimensions constrainted to fit within a standard adult palm. 

## **Process**
For my keychain, I referenced a badge that the fictional character "The Comedian" wears on his person.

*After I worked on v.1.1, I referenced an external video so that I could better understand how to utilize constraints before I begin extruding my sketches.*
